//  Declares IMAStreamManager interface that manages stream playback.
//  The interface represents an abstract API. There can be only one stream managed by a single
//  stream manager.
//  The implementing code should respond to the callbacks as defined in IMAStreamManagerDelegate.
//
//  A typical stream playback session:
//    1. Stream manager is retrieved. Delegate is set.
//    2. Stream playback will meanwhile start because of the adsLoader requestStream call.
//    3. delegate.didReceiveAdEvent: is called with a kIMAAdBreakStarted event.
//    4. Publisher should now hide content controls or disable seeking. Ad is now playing
//    5. delegate.didReceiveAdEvent: is called with a kIMAAdStart event. This event comes with
//       information about the ad.
//    6. delegate.didReceiveAdEvent is called with ad events like quartiles, midpoint and complete.
//    7. Ad break finishes and delegate.didReceiveAdEvent is called with a kIMAAdBreakEnded event.
//    8. Publisher should now show content controls or reenable seeking. Content is now playing.
//       playback should resume now.
//       It is possible to detach the delegate and destroy the ads manager.
//
//  Steps 3-8 may repeat several times for the same stream if there are multiple ads inserted in
//  the stream.
