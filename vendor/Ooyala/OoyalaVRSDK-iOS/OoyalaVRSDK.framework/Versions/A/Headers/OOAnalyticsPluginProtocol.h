/**
 @file  OOAnalyticsPluginProtocol.h
 @brief A protocol that can be used to plug an Analytics reporter into the OOOoyalaPlayer

 @details Your Analytics plugin may require more functionality than is reported here.  If this is the case
 you can additionally observe OoyalaPlayer, and report any other metrics through the observation chain

 You should most likely NOT implement this interface, and instead extend OOAnalyticsPluginBaseImpl
